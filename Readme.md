# Open Architecture CPU
My own fictional cpu with it's assembler and instructions
Reference is in docs/index.md

# Installing
Just clone this repo and run UnitTests.py or Emulator.py filename (No external modules are used !)

For now , Emulator.py just defaults to debugging a script by stepping line by line
